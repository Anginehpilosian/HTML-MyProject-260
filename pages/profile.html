            <h2>Why is Sustainable Management of Food Important?</h2>
        <p class="strategies">Sustainable Management of Food is a systematic approach that seeks to reduce wasted food and its associated impacts over the entire life cycle, starting with the use of natural resources, manufacturing, sales, and consumption and ending with decisions on recovery or final disposal.

            <dt><b>Saving Money</b></dt>
                <dd>When we waste food, we’re not just creating a problem, we’re also missing an opportunity to save businesses and consumers money:
                <ol>
                    <li>Pay Less for Trash Pickup: Organizations might pay less for trash pickup by keeping wasted food out of the garbage. Some haulers lower fees if wasted food is separated from the trash and sent to a compost facility instead of the landfill. </li> 
                    <li>Receive Tax Benefits by Donating: If you donate healthy, safe, and edible food to hungry people, your organization can claim tax benefits.   </li>  
                    <li>Waste Less and Spend Less: If you or your organization can find ways to prevent waste in the first place, you can spend less by buying only the food you will use. Preventing wasted food can also reduce energy and labor costs associated with throwing away good food. </li>  
                </ol>

            <dt><b>Helping People</b></dt>
                <dd>Preventing wasted food and recovering wholesome, nutritious food can help you make a difference in your community:
                <ol>
                    <li>Feed People, Not Landfills: Instead of feeding landfills, we should be feeding people in our communities. You can donate a variety of foods to many different types of organizations. Contact Food Recovery or your local food rescue organizations for information about where you can donate and what types of food your local organization is able to accept.</li> 
                    <li>Feed Children: In 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture National School Lunch Program provided nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to more than 31 million children each school day. By redirecting food that would otherwise be wasted to homes and schools, we can help feed our country’s children.</li>  
                    <li>Create Job Opportunities – Recovering and recycling wasted food through donation, salvaging, processing, industrial reuse, and composting strengthens infrastructure and creates jobs. Food recycling in these sectors employs more than 36,000 people, supporting local economies and promoting innovation. </li>
                    <li>Feed the World: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, from 2012 to 2014 there were about 805 million hungry people on earth. They predict that by eliminating food loss and wasted food we would have enough food to feed all the chronically undernourished. They also expect that we wouldn’t have to increase food production or put additional pressure on our natural resources to do so. </li>
                </ol>
                </dd>
            <dt><b>Conserving Resources</b></dt>
                <dd>Preventing wasted food and recovering wholesome, nutritious food can help you make a difference in your community:
                <ol>
                    <li>Reduce Methane from Landfills: When food goes to the landfill, it’s similar to tying food in a plastic bag. The nutrients in the food never return to the soil. The wasted food rots and produces methane gas.
                    </li> 
                    <li>Save Resources: Wasted food wastes the water, gasoline, energy, labor, pesticides, land, and fertilizers used to make the food. When we throw food in the trash, we’re throwing away much more than food.</li>  
                    <li>Return Nutrients to the Soil: If you can’t prevent, reduce or donate wasted food, you can compost. By sending food scraps to a composting facility instead of to a landfill or composting at home, you’re helping make healthy soils. Adding compost to gardens, highway construction sites, and poor soils makes great things happen. Properly composted organics (wasted food and yard waste) improve soil health and structure, improve water retention, support more native plants, and reduce the need for fertilizers and pesticides.</li>
