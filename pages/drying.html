            <a href="marketingStrategies.html"><b>Drying</b></a><br>Drying is a food preservation method that removes moisture from food to an extent that micro-organisms such as mould, yeast and bacteria cannot grow. Drying is a preservation method that is suitable for fruits, mushrooms, herbs, seaweeds, berries, flowers and vegetables.<br>A key benefit of preserving through drying is that, unlike with other methods, you can open a jar of dried food again and again without damaging the contents.<a href= "marketingStrategies.html"><b> more...</b></a><br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fruit and vegetables may be treated with sulphur dioxide before drying in order to prevent enzymatic browning; it also slows breakdown of vitamin C and kills some micro-organisms;</li>
            <li>Most vegetables except onions and garlic are blanched by dipping them in hot water for a few minutes before drying; this stops the action of enzymes which may not be killed by the sun-drying process;</li>
            <li>Green vegetables retain their colour better during drying if about 0.25 percent of bicarbonate of soda is added to the blanching water, but this will speed up the loss of vitamin C;</li>
            <li>Dried cassava forms an important part of the staple diet in parts of Africa and Latin America; the dried product may be in the form of chips, granules or flour; in some areas the grated cassava root is fermented for a short time before being dried by artificial heat or sunlight;</li>
            <li>Dried vegetable products are subject to severe insect infestation, and some may be affected by exposure to light during storage; dried produce must be stored in a very dry atmosphere, in insect-proof containers and away from light. ·</li>

        <h2>How to make Persian fruit leather</h2>
        <p class="drying">
        Lavashak or Persian fruit leather is one of Iranians’ favourite snacks. Lavashak or fruit leather is made of different fruits. A thick extract of fruits is made and then dried in order to make Lavashak.<br>
        Iranians usually make Lavashak at the end of summer, this is due to several reasons. First, from the old times, Iranians used to dry fruits or make fruit leather in the summer to be able to access fruit supplies in winter. Another reason is the great variety of fruits in the summer resulting in fruit rolls with different flavours.</p>
        <h2>How to make Lavashak?</h2>
        <p class="drying">One of the most popular kinds of Persian fruit leather is made with plums. Lavashak made with plum alone is quite sour, therefore to balance the taste a few apples are added.<br>
        To make Lavashak, fruits should be well washed. The stem parts and leaves should be removed. It is also better to remove the skin of fruits like apples which are easy to peel. <br>
        <img src="../images/lavashak4.jpg" height="400" width="500" alt="Dry food" /><br>    
        Put the fruits in a pot and pour in a little amount of water. Put on mild heat and stir frequently until the fruits are well baked and easily mashed. You can add salt at this point. Try adding salt little by little and keep tasting the mixture to avoid extra amounts of salt.<br>
        <img src="../images/lavashak5.jpg" height="400" width="500" alt="Dry food" /><br>  
        Pour the mashed mixture into a sieve to separate the remaining seeds and fruit peels and to form a smooth mixture.<br>
        The fruit mixture is ready to get dried. To prepare the tray you may grease it with a little amount of oil, put a plastic layer or simply put a silicon pad. Pour the fruit mixture on the tray evenly. You can decide how thick you want your Lavashak to be; the ideal thickness is about three to four millimetres.
