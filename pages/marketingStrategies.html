        <p class="strategies">Instead of allowing fruits and vegetables go to waste, you could get them together and whip up some unusual juices, pastes and purees. This is one way to make use of discarded fruits and vegetables whilst also making an income for yourself. 
        <br>
        You could source your raw materials mainly from farmers. You can request them to sell you fruits and vegetables that did not make it to supermarket shelves at much reduced cost. You equally need to employ good <b>marketing strategies</b> for you to sell of your unusual juices, pastes and purees.<br>
        The resultant feed is used to feed fly larvae, which in turn is used to feed chickens and farm-raised fish</p>

        Drying is a food preservation method that removes moisture from food to an extent that micro-organisms such as mould, yeast and bacteria cannot grow. Drying is a preservation method that is suitable for fruits, mushrooms, herbs, seaweeds, berries, flowers and vegetables.<br>A key benefit of preserving through drying is that, unlike with other methods, you can open a jar of dried food again and again without damaging the contents.<a href= "drying.html"><b> more...</b></a><br>

        <a href="freezing.html"><b>Freezing (Blanching) </b></a><br>Many vegetables, such as hardy greens (broccoli, sprouts and green beans), root veggies (carrots, parsnips, cauliflower, squashes and sweet potatoes) are best blanched before freezing. Blanching is a technique that involves exposing foods to boiling water or steam for a short period of time and then rapidly cooling them to prevent cooking (this is called refreshing). It stops enzymes in the food from activating, kills micro-organisms and improves the colour, texture and nutrients of frozen foods.
