        <a href="bottom"><b>Freezing (Blanching) </b></a><br>Many vegetables, such as hardy greens (broccoli, sprouts and green beans), root veggies (carrots, parsnips, cauliflower, squashes and sweet potatoes) are best blanched before freezing. Blanching is a technique that involves exposing foods to boiling water or steam for a short period of time and then rapidly cooling them to prevent cooking (this is called refreshing). It stops enzymes in the food from activating, kills micro-organisms and improves the colour, texture and nutrients of frozen foods.<br>

        <h2>How to Freeze Fruit</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash fruits and set aside damaged fruit. Some fruits freeze best with a sugar or sugar-syrup preparation. Blueberries, currants, and cranberries do fine without sugar.</li>
            <li>To freeze delicate berries like strawberries or raspberries: Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Once frozen, transfer to a plastic freezer bag or container. You can also prepare delicate berries with sugar or sugar syrup.</li>
            <li>For fruits that tend to brown, like apples, peaches, nectarines and apricots, treat with ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Look for the powdered form in health food stores, drugstores, and some grocery stores in the vitamin aisle. To make an ascorbic acid wash: Dissolve 1/2 teaspoon of ascorbic acid powder (or finely crushed vitamin C tablets) in 3 tablespoons water. Sprinkle this mixture over the cut fruit. An acceptable substitute: Slice the fruit and dip the slices in an acidulated water bath — about one quart water plus a tablespoon of lemon juice — before drying and freezing.·</li>

        <h2>How to Freeze Vegetables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetables that hold up well to cooking (corn, peas) generally freeze well.</li>
            <li>To freeze vegetables, first blanch them briefly in boiling water. Then quickly submerge the vegetables in ice water to prevent them from cooking. Dry thoroughly on paper towel-lined sheet pans. See more on how to blanch and shock vegetables.</li>
            <li>Freeze vegetables quickly by spreading them in a single layer on a rimmed sheet pan.
            When the produce is frozen solid, store in air-tight containers or freezer bags. Fill hard-sided containers to the top and remove as much air as possible from freezer bags. Be sure to date the packages.</li>
